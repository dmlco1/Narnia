# Narnia
Just a statistics website to mess around

# Projeto desenvolvido por:

Owl is a website part of the Narnia project, created just for pure fun.
> - Why Narnia?
>   Well, since I don't know how to host this website, this is the same as the closet in the Chronicles of Narnia, you can't find it.

> - Why the name Owl for the website?
>   This is a website created based on webscraping with python, gathering information from statistics websites and display them in a no cookies, no adds, secure website. That being said, this is a statistics website, where you can see statistics about covid-19 and, hopefully in the future, crypto currency and stuff like that. Owls are royal creatures that have and outstanding vision capability. So, like owls that can see everythin, on this website, the ideia is that you can see all statistics ina clean format!

Owl is the most useless website in the internet, created just for fun and to improve my knowladge in python and flask. 
Here you can see statistics for covid-19 all around the world aquired from google news.
